<h2 id="#introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Project Idea:</h3>
<p>*Online photo & Art store* is a online market place where artists and photographer could exhibit or sell their art works or photos. Vendors and customers both can be benefited by this website. These days because of the busy schedule of the people, they don’t have time schedule-wise to visit the art gallery to view the paintings or photography of the famous artists. Specially sometimes we see people use paintings , photos and images without the permission of original artists and artists don’t even get credits for that. Online photo and art store is a platform where the artists can display and sell their products, it is conceivable. The online art and photo store is the application that enables the clients to sell their works and make it available to the visitor’s view.
An online art store is new concept of selling and purchasing art works, both digital prints and traditional paintings are available on online sites. Basically, it is a user interface kind of web page on which buyer and seller both gets a platform for their jobs. Online art store is a time, energy and money saving web site concept. Both vendors and customers can access this website and have their own accounts to store their personal information , works, wish lists, reviews etc. </p>

 
<h2 id="features">2. Software Specification</h2>

<h3>2.1 User Registration:</h3>

 <h2 id="#technology">3. Technology</h2>
 <h3>3.1 Proposed Technology Stack: </h3>
 <p>I used  php, css and bootstrap to build my front end.  As a compiler I used sublime text to write and run my code. 
 Finally, for the database requirement we have opted to use a mySQL database. And so we have decided to use sql for the projects database requirement.  The reason for doing so is because we have only three entities:</p>

<ul>
    <li> USER: Will keep info about the users signing in the application.<br></li>
    <li>PLATFORM: The platform information for the signed in USER entity.</li>
    <li>Product Info: The details of all the products associated with the specific categories</li>
</ul><br>

 <h3>3.2: Unfnished works</h3>
 <p> There are some features which are not working right now such as login, customer register, add to cart etc. Due to lack of time and some technical issues I could not finished the work. My xampp app was also giving hard times while I was working.</p>


<h2 id="businessplan">4. Monetization</h2>
<p>
Online photo & art store provides each and every artist with a spot in their very own online gallery to display and sell as they want. No art dealer or agent is required. There will be two types of membership options for the artists which are premium and platinum. They have to pay first a fixed amount of money to get a membership. Artists can choose any of those options and create an account to display his or her art works. On the other hand customer can create an account for free. But when they will buy something they have to pay a fixed amount of money as delivery charge. As an owner of this website I will cut a minimum amount of money as a service charge from that money. Online art gallery is a new concept of trending for modern art lovers who want to purchase art works but unable to come to gallery or being in their comfort zone. The Social impact of e commerce system is extensive, while our online market is evolving  rapidly.  A lot of experienced entrepreneurs are working in online close to offline. Art and art products always considered as a luxurious item but in online market place artists and common people get closer each other very easily. An artist could be beneficiary by this.  </p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
<p id="#conclusion">

 The online shopping concept  makes one believe that shopping is not a going out thing anymore. With the evolution of technology and what it can offer the user in terms of experience and overall engagement and above all the reach factor – online is emerging as a very strong medium. Additionally, online art galleries act as a perfect foil for customer’s offline experience. Online medium could be considered as a very good vehicle for building the artist brand which becomes a very important factor in decision making. Specially in the pandemic situations like recent times, online art stores getting popular very fast. Digital arts are one of the new art forms these days which are easily showed and sell in online platform. The beauty of Online Art Marketplaces lies in the fact that it is not restricted to the wealthy. As mentioned earlier that the artists onboard are of different caliber. Some are new but extremely talented and hence would display their works at an affordable range. This is definitely where the middle class and upper middle class can buy their wished art peace. The only challenge for an online medium is to build trust among new buyers and also create loyalty, it would make buying art online a less intimidating job.</p>
